Whats up developers, 13 year IG veteran here. Hope all is well. I have two questions for you. (1.) Would you enforce us to make pancakes without flour if you discovered gluten-free methods were becoming popular? (2.) Would you eradicate the usage of all pens or pencils just because we now have the keyboard? No. Iâm sure you wouldnât. As a matter of fact, I believe you would provide us with the option to decide. The rectangular grid system is uprooting a fundamental element that made IG what it was. Remember back in the day when IG filters came with a SQUARE frame option? In the grand scheme of things, this is obviously a 1st world problem, but in regards to making the decision to keep the rectangular system, Iâve noticed that even you havenât made your mind up. Youâve changed it back and forth several times, and of my two profiles, sometimes one of them has a square profile grid, and the other has rectangle, and thatâs just from me toggling from one to the other in the same minute. I believe a rectangle display works as a fantastic method for displaying IG Reels, but I think we can all agree that squares are a foundational display method. I would suggest maybe adding an option in the settings menu so users, like myself, have the option to display a rectangular or square profile feed at their own discretion. Hope this helps.
